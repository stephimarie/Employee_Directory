## Description

This React app gives business professionals the ability to access their employees, and easily search, filter,
and sort through their entire directory.
For example, employers may search for specific employees via the search field, sort a field (Name, Email, DOB) in ascending or descending order. The employee directory is populated with randomly generated users via an API call to the [**Random User API**](https://randomuser.me/). This API simply generates random user data, including - a photo, title, name, gender, age, e-mail and mobile phone number. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
